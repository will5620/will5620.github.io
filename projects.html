    <h1>Database Project</h1>
    <div class="row">
        <div style="flex:50%;">
          In my databases class we were given quarter semester project where we were asked to create a database for a fictional company. We were given a background of the company including inventory, countries of operation, cash receipts and disbursements, and production cycles. We had to conceptualize the ERDs, which resulted in many different versions of ERDs. Then we had to check for data integrity issues using a data dictionary and make sure our data was in 3NF.
